# Analyze for games store. Popular platforms and genres in different regions.

Our client is a game store. We have some historical information about sales, rating from users and experts, genres and platforms from open-source data. We need to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

We must:
1. Prepare the data (fill the gaps, change types of the data)
2. Count summary sales on the regions and add them to another column
3. Investigate the data:
 * How many games were released in other years? Is it significant to save all data?
 * Choose the platforms which gave more revenue. Create graphics
 * Create box plots for global sales games on the platform
 * How impact reviews of users and experts for the most popular platform? Create a scatterplot and correlation between reviews and sales
 * What genres are most popular and unpopular?
4. Create a users portrait for every region (NA, EU, JP)
 * TOP-5 popular platforms
 * TOP-5 genres
 * How are ESRB ratios impacting sales?
5. Check out hypotheses
 * The mean user ratio between Xbox One and PC is the same
 * The mean user ratio between 'Action' and 'Sports' isn't the same
