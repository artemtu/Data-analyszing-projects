# Discover users behavior in Mobile app for order goods

Graphic designers would like to change shrifts in the mobile app, but managers think it can be useless and have a bad impact on buyers. Data analyst should discover data and give them a conclusion.

We have a csv file with columns:
- EventName;
- DeviceIDHash — user id;
- EventTimestamp ;
- ExpId — expiriment id: 246 and 247 is control groups 248 is an experimental group

## Short conclusion
We have no difference between experinetal and main groups
